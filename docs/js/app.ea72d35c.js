I contacted Harvard Print in a pinch. I usually go to larger printing companies for my small print projects so this is my first experience with Harvard. I needed to get high quality printing for a wedding program I created and the companies I have used did not produce acceptable proofs for such an important print project. I was in a panic only having a few days to get this project completed and contacted Harvard based on the favorable reviews on Yelp. I am so happy that I did! Marc was extremely helpful from start to finish. He reviewed my document and gave me a quick quote that came in significantly less than the other places I tried first (not to mention his quote included cutting to size, scoring and folding the cardstock). Marc printed a proof to review and I was beyond impressed with both the cardstock and print quality.  I immediately approved the proof and Marc quickly completed the project knowing I was on a tight timeline.
